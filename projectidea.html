										<h1>My Project Idea</h1>
									</header>


									<h2>Overview</h2>

									<p>The project I am proposing is a simple maintenance application that bridges the gap between tracking programs already in use by major freight companies within Australia and maintenance software utilized by workshops in Australia. The goal is to reduce maintenance times, increase productivity of trucks and prevent breakdowns, thus increasing profit margins for all parties involved.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Motivation</h2>
				
									<p>The freight industry in Australia is worth over $5 billion dollars, a part of this is the maintenance required to keep the trucks moving on the road. In 2019 there was 103,038 articulated trucks and 353,759 heavy rigid trucks registered in Australia, these numbers are growing at 2% and 1.5% a year respectively. (Motor Vehicle Census, Australia, 31 Jan 2019 | Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2020)</p>
									<p>There already exists programs that can GPS track vehicles in a fleet and relay instantly the speed, fuel consumption and location to an office computer. When a truck rolls into a workshop for a service and/or repair. The mechanic plugs a computer into the trucks diagnostic port and can run a series of tests to determine and diagnose problems before deciding on a course of action. </p>
									<p>An application that bridges the gap between maintenance and tracking allowing a mechanic to remotely connect to the truck on the way into the workshop to run the tests therefore allowing them to order parts and even diagnose a problem before it arrives in the workshop. This would mean that the truck would spend less time in the workshop and less time off the road thus allowing for increased productivity from the freight company and workshop.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Description</h2>

									<p>The maintenance software is very powerful and able to control almost all of trucks systems including driving and brakes, therefore certain safety protocols will have to be included to prevent and accident occurring. Such as a command to disable the brakes being entered while the truck is driving. Also, a layer of encryption will be added to the technology that links the truck to an office computer to stop any malicious attacks.</p>
									<p>Once a connection between the truck and office has been established the workshop could request that the software run a basic diagnostic test and return the results to them. A basic diagnostic test would show any fault codes stored in the ECMs. After this further specific test may be run such an injector leak down test, compression test, transmission solenoid test or actuator tests. Being able to run these tests remotely through and uplink without a mechanic present will save maintenance hours and time on the workshop floor.</p>
									<p>With the advancement of automotive technology vehicles are incorporating more sensors into their operating systems. It is not uncommon for vehicles to have brake pad wear sensors, coolant level sensors, tire pressure sensors and fuel pressure sensors. Being able to use the maintenance software remotely to pull these values out of the ECMs and create a spreadsheet of their values will enable a mechanic to predict an issue with a truck and repair it before it becomes a breakdown issue. Breakdowns are extremely costly to freight companies as they have to spend extra money to recover or fix the trucks on the side of the road and the freight is delayed.</p>
									<p>As technology further advances, the ability to update the software remotely and add in functionality that further utilizes the hardware as its evolved will be a benefit to both the freight and workshop companies.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

									<p>The application would further utilize the current technology that already links the truck in real-time to an office by allowing the maintenance software from the workshop to interrogate the truck ECMs. To achieve this would require an extra computer being added to the truck, this computer would be directly connected to the On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) socket. The computer would have to set up with maintenance software and be able to be turned on remotely by the office. Once turned on it needs to be able to accept commands from the office and return the required data, adding it to a spreadsheet if required.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Skills Required</h2>

									<p>The project will require will require a lot of programming to get different applications to talk to each other effectively, also a programmer that specializes in security would be needed to ensure that the system couldnâ€™t be hacked, and to provide updates in the future. The required skills are already out in the working community in abundance.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Outcome</h2>

									<p>If the is successful than workshop mechanics will be able to diagnose and plan services and repairs more efficiently and increase workshop and freight company profitability. If the system work effectively it could progress down into light vehicle fleets owned by companies or even the military.</p>

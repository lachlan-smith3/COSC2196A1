									<h2>Myers-Briggs Test</h2>
									<p>The Myers-Briggs test is a phsychological test that sorts a person into one of 16 unique categories based on how they percieve the world and make decisions.</p>
									<p>I took the test online at <a href="http://www.16personalities.com">16 Personalities</a> and my results indicated that I have a "Logistician" personality. <br><em>"Few personality types are as practical and dedicated as Logisticians. Known for their reliability and hard work, Logisticians are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. Logisticians’ dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."<a href="http://www.16personalities.com"> - 16 Personalities</a></em></p>
									<p>To me, being a logistician means that I mission oriented, I will focus on completing a given task and not so much on the way I will complete it. A logistician is able to be relied upon to complete their tasks on time to the standard required.</p>
									<p>When forming a team, a logistician is a good personality type to employ as they will be loay and able to deliver the required work consistantly. However they will only be as good as the leader of the workgroup, logisticians need strong leadership to steer the project and delegate tasks evenly as to not overwhelm any one worker.</p>
									<p>My view point is only one of many interpritations of the is test and has been influenced by my time in the Army, others from different backgrounds will see different positives and negatives of the logistician.</p>

									<h2>Lerning Style Test</h2>
									<p>The online learning style test from <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org">EducationPlanner.org</a> is a self assessment tool used to figure out which learning style suit you.</p>
									<p>My results from the test indicated that I was a predominantly tactlie learner (50%) with the other two learning styles of auditory and visual sharing the remain 50% evenly.</p>
									<p>Being a tactile learner means that I learn best from doing what I am learning. As a tactile learner I would prefer to deconstruct things and reassemble them to understand how they work. Tactile learners are better suited to learning during on-the-job training.</p>
									<p>When forming a team that has tactile learners it may be better to give them a working example of the sort of result needed so that they see what is expected of them, deconstruct the process and build upon it to be even better.</p>

									<h2>Name of resiliance test</h2>
									I took the test at <a href="https://www.psychometrictest.org.uk/">www.psychometrictest.org.uk/</a> The test determines your resiliance over five personality traits being:
									<ul>
										<li>Adaptability</li>
										<li>Self-Control</li>
										<li>Self-Sufficiency</li>
										<li>Optimism</li>
										<li>Persistance</li>
									</ul>
									<p>In the Adaptability trait I scored 33/50, this rates as a fairly-high. I can respond well to change and can overcome criticism, obsticles and opposition to achieve the required outcome.</p>
									<p>In the Self-Control trait I scored 45/50, this rates as a high. I am methodical and rational when making decisions, I do not let emotions control my actions. I am able to strongly resist distractions and avoid procrastination when it comes to tasks given to me.</p>
									<p>In the Self-Sufficiency trait I scored 39/50, this rates as a fairly-high. I am able to work autonomously to complete a required task, when difficulties arrise I am more likely to find a solution on my own then engage outside help.</p>
									<p>In the Optimism trait I scored 38/50, this rates as a fairly high. When difficulties arrise I am able to maintain a positive veiw on the situation for a longer duration.</p>
									<p>In the Persistance trait I scored 46/50, this rates as a high. I am able to work through long peroids of adversity without giving up to accomplish a task. I am likely to step up and take on additional responsibilities if the oppurtunity arrises.</p>
									<p>Overall I feel this accurately depicts my high level of resiliance. My resiliance has allowed me to adapt to many hurdles in my life and career and come out in a better way.</p>
									<p>When forming a team, it is preferable to include members that have a higher level of resiliance. This is beacuse they are able to react better if obstacles or setbacks occur in the project.</p>

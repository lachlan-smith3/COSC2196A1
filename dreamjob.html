										<h1>What Is My Dream Job In Information Technology</h1>
									</header>
									
									<h2>Overview</h2>	
									<p>My dream job is to one day be a commanding officer of a submarine within the Royal Australian Navy. Being a commander on a submarine is a mentally challenging position that involves being responsible for a multi-million dollar asset as well as the lives of the crew. I would be responsible for ensuring that both the crew and submarine were kept in war-fighting order, including weapons, mechanical and electrical systems, food and logistic supplies. </p>
									<p>This job appeals to me as I already live a very structured life and would include very little shift in the way I live my life. I am currently responsible for a small workshop and its staff, taking responsibility for 60 crew members and an expensive piece of equipment is something that would provide me with great pride and a sense of purpose.</p>

									<h2>Skills, Qualifications and Expierence Required</h2>
									<p>The career path to become a submarine commander starts with becoming a Marine Warfare Office (MWO) Submariner. To gain entry into this entry level job in the ADF I am required to be medically and physically fit, have a degree, pass an aptitude test, pass a selection board interview and be capable of obtaining a NV1 security clearance.</p>
									<p>After gaining the job and passing all initial and job training I will have to spend about 18 years working on a submarine and conducting further specific training through the ADF as well as being competitive for promotive by upholding the values of the Royal Australian Navy.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>My Current Skills, Qualifications and Expierence</h2>
									<p>I already far exceed the required medical and fitness benchmarks required to gain entrance into the Royal Australian Navy. I have already attended a recruitment off and passed the required aptitude test and hold a NV1 security clearance. Having already worked in the Australian Army I believe I already have the knowledge and ability to pass the selection board interview.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>How I Plan To Achieve the Skills, Qualifications And Experience I Lack</h2>
									<p>I currently only hold a Certificate III in Heavy Automotive Technology, but have enrolled in a Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT to achieve the required level of education for entry into the Navy as a MWO. Once I have gained entry I will accrue the required experience over the course of my career in the hopes of becoming a submarine commander.</p>

									<h2>Job Advirtisement</h2>
									<p>The ADF does not directly recruit submarine commanding officers and as such no job advirtisment exists. However there is an advirtisment for the entry level MWO Submariner job of which I have included in the PDF linked below.</p>

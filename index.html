											<h1>Hi, My name is <br />Lachlan Smith</h1>
											<p>And this is my profile.</p>
										</header>
										<p><em>Student ID:    </em>S3865136</br>
										<em>Email Address: </em>s3865136@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
										<p>I am from  Townsville, QLD and currently work full-time as a heavey diesel mechanic whilst also studying a Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT university full-time.</p>
										<p>I grew up on the east coast of Australia, spending most of my time at the beach. I am a profficient swimmer and spend some time as a lifeguard when I was younger. I joined the Army out of school and have served on operations both within Australia and the Middle East.</p>
										<p>My hobbies include surfing and working on classic british cars, I own two 1960's Morris Mini's and my brother owns a 1959 Austin Healey Sprite. The love of classic British cars stem from my grandfather teaching me how to work on them as a young child.</p>
										<p>I like to maintain a high level of fitness and spend alot of time in the gym, I plan to compete in an olympic length triathlon by the end of 2020</p>
